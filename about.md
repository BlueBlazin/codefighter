On this blog you'll find articles explaining solutions to various coding challenges from codefights.com.

I come from the Sedgewick school of algorithm implementation, which is to say I first learned algorithms from the excellent two part online course taught by Robert Sedgewick. This style of writing algorithms, or at least my interpretation of it, involves making the code as short and succinct as possible, but not more.

I will try to build the solutions up from scratch, almost always explaining my thought process along the way. Most code will be built up incrementally in logical chunks that, I hope, will make most sense to the reader.

Thank you for visiting this blog, and I hope it helps you become better at solving algorithmic challenges using a logical and scientific approach.
